    " One-click image sorting/labelling script. Copies or moves images from a folder into subfolders. \n",
    " This script launches a GUI which displays one image after the other and lets the user give different labels\n",
    " from a list provided as input to the script. In contrast to original version, version 2 allows for \n",
    " relabelling and keeping track of the labels.\n",
    " Provides also short-cuts - press \"1\" to put into \"label 1\", press \"2\" to put into \"label 2\" a.s.o.\n",
    "\n",
    " USAGE:\n",
    " run 'python sort_folder_vers2.py' or copy the script in a jupyter notebook and run then\n",
    "\n",
    " you need also to provide your specific input (source folder, labels and other) in the preamble\n",
